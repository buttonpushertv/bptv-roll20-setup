# My Roll20 Setup
This repo is a collection of instructions, files, link, etc.

Roll20 is a really good Virtual Tabletop. There are a few areas where the interface is lacking or the capabilities are almost what you want...thankfully there are several modifications you can make to Roll20 to extend it's feature set.

I'm collecting (& refining) my Roll20 setup here - partly to have a place to organize and store all these bits & pieces. And also to share how I do it with others who are figuring this stuff out as well.

## <a name="browser_setup"></a>Browser Setup
A great feature of Roll20 is that it runs in nearly any modern web browser. The 2 I have found that work best are Google Chrome & Firefox. (Also a few of the add-ons I use *require* one of those two browsers.)

In the past, I've run Roll20 in my everyday browser. That works OK, but there are a few mods that I use that may compromise security somewhat, so in an attempt to segregate things a little, I've started using a 2nd instance of Google Chrome (using Portable Chrome via [Portable Apps](https://portableapps.com/)).

##### Why a full Portable Apps install?
This allows an easy place to store all the files related to My Roll20 Setup. It also allows easy transfer to any Windows system (that allows external devices) with all my stuff already setup and configured. I also use Resilio Sync to keep it backed up between my Desktop & Laptop. Additionally, using Portable Apps allows me to install any of the apps they've got at the site I may want to use for gaming & keep them segregated.
